This is a basic iOS app that will display the Operational Dataset for your preferred Thread Network.

I built it as a way to merge the Thread Network created by my Homepods with my Open Thread Border Router.

> This app is entirely local and your credentials are only displayed within the app.

Upon launch, it will display this screen:

You will then need to grant the app permission to access your home network before the full operational dataset can be displayed
